# cover-type-classification
## Introduction
The United States of America has many diverse biomes (deserts, forests, mountains...etc).
Forests in particular have many trees that form a cover over the forest.
The types of these covers can be determined from certain factors; such as elevation and soil types.

## Problem statement
Can this model be used to predict the classification of forest cover types?

## Data Description
The data was downloaded from **archive.ics.uci.edu** which predicts forest cover type from cartographic variables.
